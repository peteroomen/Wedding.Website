      h4 Our Story
      p. 
        Our story started offically one summer evening, after spending the day with some close friends of ours. Unofficially however, it started well before that. You see, we had been very close friends most of our teen years, and hung out a lot. After finishing school, Peter had moved away to attend University in Hamilton, and Megan stayed back in The Bay. Our time hanging out was limited to just the summers, in which we spent most of our time relaxing and swimming at Papamoa beach. We also liked to do other couply things together just the two of us, including walking the dog (Ollie). We were constantly teased by our mutal friends that we were basically dating. We were oblivious to all of this of course and just laughed it off.

        Life happened and Peter had his daughter, Jamie. It was just after Jamie's first New Years, and we made the trip to Gisborne together (still not dating), where we spent the afternoon with Jamie at the beach. We also ate butter chicken together, in Peter's car, looking out over the beach and watching the sun set. Peter would go on to tell Megan later that this day was the day he had realized we were more then just friends, and that he was in love with Megan. About a week or so after that, after another the day at the beach, we watched a movie together (Transformers 3, awful), and ended up discussing what would happen if we did date, eventually deciding that we should give it a go! After this we were even more inseperable than ever, totally smitten. When we told our families, they replied "finally!", much to our disapointment. The rest of the summer was spent together, us being a sickly adorable couple, trying to figure out how we could avoid spending any time apart at all.

        After dating a few months, Peter had to return to University. Megan was trying to find a job in Early Childhood, but there wasnt anything avalible in Tauranga. Megan started to look for work in Hamilton, and after a few months, Megan managed to find both a job and a flat, and so she moved over. About a year after that, Peter proposed. On the beach straight after a swim, he started playing our song on Megan's bluetooth speaker, and asked me to marry him.
